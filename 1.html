  <p>Havana, ooh na-na (ay)
  Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)
  He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
  Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ay)
  There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh huh)
  Havana, ooh na-na (uh)
  He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?" (uh)
  (When he came in the room)

  </p>
  He said there's a lot of girls I can do with (uh)
  (But I can't without you)
  I knew him forever in a minute (hey)
  (That summer night in June)
  And papa says he got malo in him (uh)
  He got me feelin' like
  Ooh-ooh-ooh, I knew it when I met him
  I loved him when I left him
  Got me feelin' like
  Ooh-ooh-ooh, and then I had to tell him
  I had to go, oh na-na-na-na-na
